# Luna | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luna-rs/luna.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/luna-rs/luna) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lare96/luna/master/LICENSE.txt)
Luna is a Runescape emulator that aims to correct all of the fundamental issues accumulated over the various releases of it's predecessor [Asteria](https://github.com/lare96/asteria-3.0).

Some of the sweetness within Luna
- high performing and scalable code <b>where it matters most</b>
- lightweight abstraction models that avoid [featuritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep)  
- effective management of the host computer's resources 
- flexible, event-based Scala plugin system for game content
- highly documented code


# Goals
Currently, the Runescape private server scene is plagued with somewhat of a dilemma. One half of servers are lightweight, easy to understand, but perform poorly; while the other half perform very well, but contain a lot of bloat and overcomplicated code.

The goal of Luna (and its predecessor, Asteria) is to rectify this by being fast and scalable, while still being <b>relatively</b> lightweight and easy to understand.
